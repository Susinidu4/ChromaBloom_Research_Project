</p>

ChromaBloom is an applied research and system-development project that aims to build a personalized cloud-based AI platform to support the cognitive development of children with Down Syndrome while empowering their caregivers. The project integrates software engineering, AI/ML modelling, digital health design, and user-centered evaluation to create a unified tool tailored to the Sri Lankan special-needs community.

At its core, ChromaBloom addresses a major gap in Sri Lanka: families raising children with Down Syndrome often lack structured developmental tools, continuous progress tracking, and accessible emotional support for caregivers. The system provides a digital ecosystem that connects learning, routines, caregiver well-being, and predictive analytics into one cohesive platform.

ChromaBloom aims to become a pioneering AI ecosystem for neurodevelopmental support. By integrating cognitive learning, stress tracking, scheduling, and predictive analytics, it enhances day-to-day caregiving and improves the quality of life for families of children with Down Syndrome.

## 🧩 Core System Components

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Interactive Visual Task Scheduler** | • Helps caregivers create, manage, and guide daily routines using visual cues.<br>• Supports structure, consistency, and behavioral improvement. |
| **Gamified Knowledge Builder** | • Provides age-appropriate learning activities for children.<br>• Tracks attention, motor skills, memory, and problem-solving skills. |
| **Cognitive Profiling & Prediction** | • Uses behavioral data and activity performance to predict developmental progress.<br>• Helps caregivers understand how the child is improving over time. |
| **Caregiver Stress Monitoring & Support System** | • Tracks stress using journaling, digital wellbeing data, and mood inputs.<br>• Generates personalized, evidence-based recommendations to reduce burnout. |


## Research Purpose
This research aims to develop and evaluate an AI-driven digital ecosystem that supports both children with Down Syndrome and their caregivers by:
- Enhancing cognitive engagement through personalized, interactive learning experiences  
- Reducing caregiver stress using emotional tracking and digital wellbeing insights  
- Providing structured and adaptive daily routine management  
- Delivering data-driven cognitive progress predictions to aid early intervention 

## Methodology
The project follows a rigorous, ethical, and user-centered approach that includes:
- **Mixed-method data collection** combining qualitative and quantitative inputs  
- **Non-invasive behavioral and emotional metrics** gathered through app interactions  
- **AI/ML models** for personalization, stress analysis, and developmental prediction  
- **Strict ethical protocols**, including informed consent, anonymization, and secure encrypted data storage
